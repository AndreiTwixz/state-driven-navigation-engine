Developed a C++ browser history management engine designed to simulate and control deterministic web navigation states through a dynamic temporal data structure. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application implements a custom state-truncation algorithm to manage linear navigation flows and pointer-based topological traversal. The system utilizes a specific mathematical truncation logic (H_new = {h_0, h_1, ..., h_i} U {P_new}) to guarantee O(1) forward-history invalidation upon branch divergence when accessing new topological nodes. The active state dynamically validates cyclic hardware inputs against memory bounds, ensuring strict spatial separation between the static page repository and the temporal sequence matrix.
